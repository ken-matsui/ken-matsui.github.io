- Rules
	- Not necessarily being a complete tree
	- Every node's value is greater than its left child and less than its right child
		- $x.left.value < x.value < x.right.value$
	- Every node should be balanced
		- $-1 \le x.left.height - x.right.height \le 1$
- Formulae
	- Maximum nodes of height $h$: $2^h-1$
	- Minimum nodes of height $h$:
		- $S(0) = 1$
		- $S(1) = 2$
		- $S(h) = 1 + S(h - 2) + S(h - 1)$
- Time Complexity
	- find, insert, delete: $O(\log{n})$
	- built tree: $O(n\log{n})$
