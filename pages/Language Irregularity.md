- Let L be $\{0^n 1^n 0^n : n \ge 0\}$.
- Let D be an arbitrary DFA.
- Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that D accepts L.
- Consider $S : 0^n 1^n$.
- Since S contains infinitely many strings, and D has a finite number of states, two strings in S must end up in the same state.
- Say these strings are $0^i 1^i$ and $0^j 1^j$ such that $i \neq j$.
- Append the string $0^j$ to both of these strings. The two resulting string are:
- $a = 0^i 1^i 0^j$, $a \in L$
- $b = 0^j 1^j 0^i$, $b \notin L$ since $i \neq j$
- Since a, b both end up in the same state, but $a \in L$ and $b \notin L$, that state must be both an accept and reject state.
- That's a contradiction.
- Since D was arbitrary, there is no DFA that recognizes L, so L is not regular.
