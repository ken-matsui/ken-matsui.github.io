-
- $a \equiv (\text{mod } m)$ ($a \% m = b \% m$)
- $m \mid (a - b)$ or $m \mid (b - a)$
- $\exists k (a - b = mk)$ or $\exists k (b - a = mk)$
-
- divides
	- $a \mid b$ iff $\exists (k \in \mathbb{Z}) b = ka$
-
- An integer $p > 1$ is prime if its only positive divisor are 1 and itself.
- gcd(a, b) is the largest integer c such that $c \mid a$ and $c \mid b$.
-
- $2 \mid 4$
- $4 \nmid 2$
- $2 \mid -2$
- $5 \mid 0$
- $0 \nmid 5$
- $1 \mid 5$
-
- x is even iff $\exists k (x = 2k)$
- x is odd iff $\exists k (x = 2k + 1)$
-
- x is rational iff $\exists a \exists b (x = \frac{a}{b}) (b \neq 0)$
	- (have no common factors except for 1)
	- (the gcd of $a$ and $b$ is $1$)
-
- $\frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad - bc}{bd}$
- $2 \cdot 3^{k - 1} + 3^{k - 1} = 3 \cdot 3^{k - 1} = 3^k$
